# Game Success Analysis
An analytical task for an online store, Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. We need to determine the chances a game has of succeeding.

# Goal
The purpose of this project is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not in order to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. We need to analyze the data based on sales, platform, genre, reviews, and ratings. We would also need to form hypotheses to prove if the distribution among certain platforms and certain genres is similar.

# Hypothesis Testing
- The average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are similar.
- The average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres differ.
